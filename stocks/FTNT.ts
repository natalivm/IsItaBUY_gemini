  strategicNarrative:
    "Fortinet owns the ASIC-driven SASE platform play in cybersecurity — proprietary silicon gives a cost/performance edge that cloud-native peers can't match, with 32.5% FCF margins and a $4.6B net cash fortress. " +
    "The problem: RS 27 signals institutions aren't buying, and at current valuation the stock is fairly priced — upside requires proof that SASE adoption is accelerating vs cloud-native competitors. " +
    "If firewall refresh cycle + SASE convergence drives sustained mid-teens growth, this re-rates as a cybersecurity compounder. If growth stays single-digit, the premium multiple compresses. " +
    "Hold for existing positions; entry improves materially on a pullback or SASE inflection.",
