  strategicNarrative: "Arista is the pure-play backbone of the AI cluster with an EOS moat and hyperscaler lock-in. FY26 guided at $11.25B (+25% YoY) with AI networking at $3.25B. Quality is undeniable — 47% FCF margin, zero debt, strong campus diversification. DCF with discount rate calibrated to ANET's fortress balance sheet supports a BUY at current levels. Key risk remains P/E compression if AI capex decelerates, but sustained 15%+ growth and margin durability justify a premium exit multiple.",
