  strategicNarrative:
    "BKNG is a high-quality travel compounder with a dominant two-sided marketplace moat. " +
    "Q4'25 call confirmed: 2026 algo targets ~9% CC top line (8% algo + 100 bps), mid-teens EPS growth, +50 bps EBITDA margin — even after $700M incremental reinvestment. " +
    "Transformation Program delivers $550M annual run-rate savings (end-2025), $500-550M in-year savings in 2026, self-funding growth investments with ROI discipline. " +
    "Capital return: 2025 FCF ~$9.1B, returned $8.2B (~90%). Since 2022: $29B buybacks, -22% net share count. ~4% annual net share reduction modeled in DCF. " +
    "LLM/AI risk addressed by CEO Fogel: LLMs may become new top-of-funnel, but merchant-of-record, supply integrations, payments, regulatory compliance, and service = deep moat at bottom of funnel. More likely a new paid traffic channel (like Google was) than an existential threat. " +
    "At ~15-16x forward P/E, market prices BKNG as cyclical trough — below historical 16-30x range. " +
    "DCF base fair value ~$7.7k (~93% upside) including ~4% annual net share reduction. FCF yield ~7-8% provides downside cushion. " +
    "RS 15 = no momentum — value entry, not breakout. Risks: travel macro slowdown (mgmt notes 'thoughtful discretionary spending'), EU regulation, Google distribution risk.",

    'People cut back on travel due to a recession. Booking\'s revenue only grows 4-5% a year — basically treading water. ' +
      'New EU regulations squeeze the fees Booking charges hotels, and AI chatbots start stealing some customers who used to search on Booking.com. ' +
      'The company still generates solid cash (~33-34% of revenue), but Wall Street loses confidence and the stock gets cheap. Fair value ~$4,500 — barely above today\'s price, so you\'d earn roughly ~2% per year.',
    'Booking hits the targets management laid out: ~9% annual revenue growth, profits growing mid-teens, and the company keeps buying back ~4% of its own shares every year (making each remaining share worth more). ' +
      'They\'re funding growth by cutting $550M in internal costs, not by spending more. Cash generation improves from 34% to 36% of revenue over five years as they earn more from payments processing. ' +
      'The stock isn\'t expensive today at ~16x earnings (it historically trades at 16-30x). Fair value ~$7,700 — nearly double today\'s price, a ~14% annual return driven by the business actually growing, not by hype.',
    'Travel demand stays strong longer than expected and Booking\'s AI-powered personalization helps them win even more bookings. They earn more per transaction as they handle payments directly instead of just connecting buyers and sellers. ' +
      'The company aggressively buys back ~5% of shares per year, turbocharging per-share growth. AI chatbots turn out to be a new advertising channel for Booking (like Google search ads were) rather than a threat — ' +
      'because when you actually want to book and pay, you still need Booking\'s hotel network, payment system, and customer support. Fair value ~$10,300 — more than 2.5x today\'s price.',
